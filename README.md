# My First Rails app!

This is my first pinteresting-like web application powered by Ruby on Rails!

In this application you can sign up and create a pin by uploading an image and writing a description. The image will be publicly displayed on the home page. The pin can be deleted or modified anytime only by the user that created it.

A great learning experience!
